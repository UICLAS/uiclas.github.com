						<h2>Why digital signage?</h2>
						<p>Save time and money vs. printed signage</p>
						<p>Dynamic vs. static content</p>
						<p>Modern look (graphics and animations)</p>
						<p>Centralized control to manage multiple locations</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							Imagine we have a franchise store that has printed signage material (our product lineup, pricing list, sign advertisements around the store, etc). Let's say a month down the road our pricing structure changes; a month after that we now offer discounts when a customer purchases a combination of products; two months after that we decide to scratch the discounts; over the holidays we want to spotlight specific products relevant to that holiday, etc. Each time we go through this, we are faced with the task of updating printed materials. Moving to dynamic digital signage would save time and money over static printed materials. Initial investment may be more, but our long term future is brighter. Next imagine we have to maintain 20, 50, even 100 different locations. Having centralized control over digital signage would make updating even easier.

						<h2>Why we tried Drupal...</h2>
						<p>High cost and increasing frustration with current non-Drupal options</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							In the past year, we have been approached by numerous end users and content manages on campus who have expressed frustration and concern with their Visix and/or FourWinds displays. It was difficult for them to manage their content (either adding new content, updating existing content, or removing content). Some users even turned off their displays. The price was too much for what some users felt they were receiving / producing.

							Keep in mind, I am not going to include costs for the display itself, mounting hardware and location setup from facilities management, since these will be the same across the board for all options. The costs involved above are above and beyond these costs.

						<h2>Why we tried Drupal...</h2>
						<p>Massive redesign using Drupal for CLAS department websites</p>

						<p><small>[ <a href="http://music.uiowa.edu/">Example of the CLAS Department Website Redesign</a> ]</small></p>

						<aside class="notes">
							The beautiful theme used for the department websites designed by Ben Speare. We were tasked with using the university colors (black and gold - not the easiest combination to expand off of) and a common layout in such a way that it unified the department websites in the college into a distinct identity. Thereby letting the public know that this is an important and unique department, but it is still part of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, which in turn is part of THE University of Iowa. We had department websites of all colors of the rainbow, with varying levels of features and design.

						<h2>What we've got so far...</h2>
						<p>Theme based on identity used for the CLAS department websites</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							We took the identity that we developed for the department websites and created a theme for the digital signs. Again, black and gold aren't exactly the easiest combination of colors to work with from a design perspective, but we believe we did a more than decent job. Utilize large, bold fonts to make clarity better from greater distances. Subtle grayscale changes to display separation of information, etc.

							Since we have designed this strictly for digital signage, we designed the theme to respond to tablets, 720p, 1080p and even 2160p (4K) displays. Small handheld devices are not exactly handled while we decide what we would like to do with those.

						<h3>Drupal Core and modules</h3>
                        <p>Core</p>
                        <p>CAS</p>
                        <p>Chaos Tools</p>
                        <p>Feeds</p>
                        <p>Organic Groups</p>
                        <p>Panelizer</p>
                        <p>Panels</p>
                        <p>Views</p>

						<aside class="notes">
                            CAS allows us to utilize the university's authentication system for logins.
                            
                            Feeds allows us to listen to the RSS feeds for news and events from the College and departments to auto-populate the news and events on the digital signs. Content managers can enter a news item or event in one location and numerous additional locations can display the item.
                            
                            Organic Groups are the backbone of the digital signage. This allows us to create a group which has its own 'homepage'. The group 'homepage' becomes the digital sign for the group. For instance, we create a group called 'Chemistry'. The group homepage becomes http://clas.uiowa.edu/signs/chemistry. We then assign CAS users to the group as content managers where needed.
                            
                            Panelizer - If OG is the backbone, then Panelizer is the brain. Panelizer allows us to let content managers decide which widgets they want to use and where (within limits) the widgets will appear. I'll show you more during the live demo shortly.
                            
                            Panels and Views - These are pretty self-explanatory. Panels for drag and drop content management and Views for viewing content how we want.

                        <aside class="notes">
                            BONGO uses the BONGO API to get information about bus routes and schedules for the University's Cambus system as well as the Iowa City and Coralville transportation systems.
                            
                            Scrolling News uses Javascript to display news items similar to a CNN or ESPN ticker at the bottom of the display.
                            
                            Rotating Events uses Javascript to alternate between College and Department events.
                            
                            Department Directory Listing pulls department information from the University White Pages and displays specific information we determine. The issue with this is that the University White Pages prevent us from differentiating between active and inactive graduate students as well as staff vs. faculty in some case. This will hope to be remedied with retrieval of specific data from a new University system.
